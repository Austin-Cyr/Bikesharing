# Bikesharing
Module 14

## Overview of Analysis

- This Bike Trip Analysis was created to supplement a business investor proposal for a bikesharing company based in Des Moines, Iowa. The data analysis of the New York Citibike progrem was developed in order to demonstrate various bikesharing data points from a current program in another city. The analysis looked at several factors that a business owner or investor may want to know about their potential customers in order to see how it might look in Des Moines. The analysis was presented via a Tableau Story of numerous maps and charts that illustrate the current use of bikes during the month of August in 2019 for New York City. The full analysis can be found here https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/austin.cyr/viz/NYC_CB_Challenge_Austin_Cyr/Story1

## Results

- The results of analysis illustrate who the key consumer base is for the New York Citibike program as well identified how the consumers used the bikes. 

- The first trend that our data illustrated was that the rides initiate and end in most the same area of the city and the volume is centered around lower to mid Manhatten. This demonstrates that there is greater demand in certain areas and that the bikes in Des Moines, Iowa should be thoughtfully placed to ensure they are available in the high demand regions. This does make sense as the population density is greater in lower and mid-Manhatten than the rest of the city. However, the greater use of bikes in Manhatten may also be attributed to a potential larger size of supply than the outer areas. Further studies may need to be done to ensure the supply of bikes are avaiable to meet demand.

The above image illustrates the greatest ridership is focused on a certain part of the city and not spread out. It may also be focused on the area of the greatest population density.

The above image also illustrates that the ridership tends to end their rides relatively close to where they started in Manhatten. This shows that the riders are not significantly displacing the bikes and that they are ending their rides in a certain part of the city and not spread out. 

- The next two images illustrate the length of time that users check out the bikes. One is focused on all riders, whereas the second is focused on a gender split difference.

The above image illustrates that most riders only use the bike rentals for short trips and not for long rides.

The above image tells us that of the ridership population, males tend to ride signficantly more than females. 

- The next three heatmaps help to identify the most common times of the day that riders start their rides.

The above image shows that the greatest trip volume occurs between 5 and 7 pm during the week. It also shows that there are peaks during the morning rush hour and has an even usage during the weekend days.

The above heatmap helps to show if there is a different peak ridership between genders.

The above image shows that the greatest riders are subscribers and not one time customers, which could be tourists. 


## Summary

- The results of the analysis illustrate a few take aways of consumer behavior for the New York Citibike program and what could be seen in Des Moines, Iowa. The results helped to highlight that volume of rides starting and stopping centered on lower to mid Manhatten. The data also demonstrated the peak times when riders would start and end their rides. Additionally, the data showed that the primary consumer was the a male subscriber. While these specifics may vary in Des Moines, it gives a good indication of who the potential consumer will be in Des Moines and can help guide the business's decision regarding where to focus their bikes and who to market to. 
- I also think it might be helpful to determine the riders frequency by age and to review the start or ending location by start time/end time. These two visualizations will help one consider how to narrow down their target marketing and also assist to see any where bikes are needed at certain times.
